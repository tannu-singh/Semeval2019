### Semeval2019 Emocontext

The task of this challenge was to classify a series of dialogues between human and robot into four sentiments: happy, angry, sad, others. We extented the model from the paper [DialogueRNN: An Attentive RNN for Emotion Detection in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00405.pdf). Using Bi-LSTM we suceesfully implemented the task of multiclass sentiment prediction.
